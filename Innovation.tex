\subsection*{Innovation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Focus on an Understudied Population: 
Targeting the Black Americans with NSCLC cohort addresses a significant gap in cancer research. 
Understanding the distinct mutational signatures and evolutionary patterns in this population 
can lead to more personalized and effective treatment strategies, 
ultimately improving clinical outcomes and addressing health disparities.}
\item Comprehensive Evolutionary Analysis: 
The use of advanced computational tools, including \texttt{GRITIC} and complementary methods from Gerstung \textit{et al.}, 
to map the clonal and subclonal evolution of tumors is a significant innovation. 
This approach will provide a detailed understanding of the evolutionary dynamics and 
precise mutation timings specific to the Black Americans with NSCLC cohort.
\item Improved Precision Mutation Timing: 
Another major innovation is the development of methods for mapping the trajectories of mutational processes with improved resolution of mutation timing. 
By establishing high-resolution techniques to precisely time mutational signature activities and refining the accuracy of driver mutation timing, 
this aim will significantly enhance our understanding of cancer evolution.
\item Correlate Environmental Toxin to Higher Rates of NSCLC: 
The study will identify molecular mechanisms correlated with exposure to environmental toxins, which is a highly impactful aspect of this research. 
Understanding these correlations can lead to insights into how environmental factors contribute to cancer development and progression in Black Americans with NSCLC.
\item Development of Open-Source Tools: 
Creating accessible, user-friendly software tools that will be disseminated to the research community 
ensures that the advanced methodologies developed in this study can be widely adopted and applied in other cancer research contexts. 
This commitment to open science and collaboration is crucial to community-wide innovation by promoting broader impact and advancements in the field.
