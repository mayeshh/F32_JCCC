\subsection{Specific Aims}

The proposed research initiative aims to deepen our understanding of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) progression in Black Americans, a demographic often underrepresented in cancer research. 
By implementing and critically evaluating two distinct computational frameworks — 
the established methods from Gerstung \textit{et al.} and a novel approach integrating a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with machine learning — 
the proposal sets out to develop a comprehensive method to determine mutation timing and evolutionary patterns in NSCLC.

\paragraph*{Aim 1: \SpecificAimOne} 
\emph{Hypothesis: Applying the Gerstung \textit{et al.} method to a new dataset will provide foundational insights into the mutation and evolutionary dynamics of NSCLC in Black Americans.}

This project aims to revolutionize our understanding of NSCLC progression through cutting-edge advancements in modeling cancer evolution. 
By fulfilling these aims, the initiative is poised to bridge critical knowledge gaps in oncology, 
providing new analytical tools that map the evolution of cancer with unmatched precision. 
These advancements are expected to enhance the timing and specificity of treatment interventions 
and to lay the groundwork for tailored therapeutic strategies that are finely adjusted to the genetic and environmental profiles of individual patients, 
with special attention to the unique needs of Black communities. 
Ultimately, this research will catalyze significant improvements in early cancer detection, thereby transforming patient care and outcomes.
