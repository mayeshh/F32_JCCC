This project aims to revolutionize our understanding of NSCLC progression through cutting-edge advancements in modeling cancer evolution. 
By fulfilling these aims, the initiative is poised to bridge critical knowledge gaps in oncology, 
providing new analytical tools that map the evolution of cancer with unmatched precision. 
These advancements are expected to enhance the timing and specificity of treatment interventions 
and to lay the groundwork for tailored therapeutic strategies that are finely adjusted to the genetic and environmental profiles of individual patients, 
with special attention to the unique needs of Black communities. 
Ultimately, this research will catalyze significant improvements in early cancer detection, thereby transforming patient care and outcomes.
